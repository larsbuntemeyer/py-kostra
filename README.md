Convert [DWD-KOSTRA](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/kostra_dwd_rasterwerte/kostra_dwd_rasterwerte.html) data to `xarray` (including download).

The original DWD-KOSTRA dataset consists of a number of csv tables and additional grid definitions in excel tables.
This repository contains the python module `pykostra` which let's you easily convert those csv tables of the DWD-KOSTRA dataset to xarray.
It is supposed to create an analysis ready dataset for easy exploration of the KOSTRA dataset. 
For further scientific information, please consult the official documentation.

## Create a NetCDF file

If you are not interested in `xarray`, you can still simply create a NetCDF file using the `create-netcdf.py` script. Simply run:

```bash
python create-netcdf.py
```

## Requirements

There is an conda environmnet file in the `.binder` subdirectory, which you can use to create an environment. However, the requirements are quite basic. You only need:

* xarray
* pandas
* openpyxl (for letting pandas read excel)
* bs4 (for download)
* matplotlib (for plotting)
